# Linnia Server

This repository contains a server to query the Linnia Records and search using the Metadata.

Currenlty under construction

## Getting Started

The linnia-server requires a postgres database to connect to. You can either run a server locally, or connect to one that's hosted somewhere else.

To configure the database, ethereum and ipfs connections, you must create a `.env` file in the root of the application and set your environment variables. Here's an example of a sample file:

```
LINNIA_DB_NAME=linnia_db
LINNIA_DB_USERNAME=linnia_user
LINNIA_DB_PASSWORD=securepassword
LINNIA_ETH_PROVIDER=http://localhost:7545
LINNIA_IPFS_HOST=ipfs.infura.io
LINNIA_IPFS_PORT=5001
LINNIA_IPFS_PROTOCOL=https
LINNIA_HUB_ADDRESS=0x3af86b00df7457acd464525f9bb303190c7d5411
LINNIA_DB_TEST_NAME=linnia_test_db
LINNIA_DB_TEST_USERNAME=linnia_user
LINNIA_DB_TEST_PASSWORD=securepassword

```

## To run tests:

Running integration tests requires the use of a test database. The credentials for so much be configured in the `.env` file like so:

```
LINNIA_DB_TEST_NAME=linnia_test_db
LINNIA_DB_TEST_USERNAME=linnia_user
LINNIA_DB_TEST_PASSWORD=securepassword
```

You can use the same database as normal, but **be warned, you will lose all of the current data in your database if you run the tests.**

To run the tests, first run the server in test mode like so:

```bash
npm run test-server
```

Then, in a separate terminal window, run the tests like so:

```bash
npm run test
```

## End Points

### [GET] /records/${dataHash}

Returns a single record that matches the dataHash provided in the URI



### [GET] /records

#### Receives:

- [string] property [OPTIONAL]
- [address] owner  [OPTIONAL]

Returns all the records in the server with no arguments. The owner argument and the property are for filtering purpose.



### [GET] /users/${address}/permissions

Returns all of the permissions that belong to the user, both as a viewer and as an owner. Response looks like follows:

```json
{
	"asViewer": [],

}
```
